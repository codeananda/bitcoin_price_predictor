# Let's Predict the Price of Bitcoin ðŸ“ˆ
For this project, I build a model in Tensorflow/Keras to predict the price of Bitcoin over the next few days. I used Deep Neural Nets and LSTMs.

This was a paid project on Upwork that lasted several months. The client wanted a proof-of-concept model, so we just stuck to univariate time-series forcasting. We were both very happy with the results and the client left the following review:

## Note

This repo has not been edited or cleaned. In the near future, I will turn this into a well-written portfolio project. But, for now, here it is in its raw form.

## Libraries Used

I used Python and the following libraries:
* TensorFlow (and Keras) 2.4 
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn 
* Wandb
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Tqdm
